This is a project README file that provides information about the Headphones web application. The application offers a responsive design that automatically switches to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less. It has interactive elements such as highlighted links and buttons with opacity transition effect. The README also includes instructions for installation, usage, contributing, and licensing.

This is the README file for my "Headphones" school project.
